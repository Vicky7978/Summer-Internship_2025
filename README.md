# Summer-Internship_2025
ANALOG IC DESIGN

This repository documents my work as a student from *Silicon University* during a three-week Analog IC Design Internship in June 2025, under the mentorship of *Dr.Saroj Rout*

As an aspiring Analog IC designer, I explored the complete design flow from system level specification to schematic design, simulation, and layout using open source tools like *Xschem, NGSpice, Magic VLSI, and Netgen, based on the Skywater 130nm CMOS technology.*

The core focus was the Analog Front-End (AFE) design for a USB Microphone, along with essential analog building blocks like current mirrors, differential amplifiers, and folded cascode opamps. Simulations and characterization were also supported using Python.

This repository serves as a consolidated and version-controlled record of my learning, simulations, and project implementation.

### Sample Simulation Result

### 1. Thevenin's Model of a Microphone
<ul>
    The Circuit demonstrates a practical application of Analog Design Principle

</ul>

### 2. NMOS Operational Amplifier
<ul>
    In an n-channel E-MOSFET, a positive gate voltage creates a conducting path by attracting electrons.

</ul>

### 3. Differential Amplifier
<ul>
    It amplifies the difference between two input signals and is widely used in analog signal processing, especially in operational amplifiers.

</ul>

### 4. Siliwiz Simulation 
<ul>
     SiliWiz uses a SPICE simulator to turn what you've drawn into a functional circuit.                                                                                            <img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (535)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1dbcf04-e3bc-4a6c-89d6-d4776bdb383f" />

</ul>

### 5. High-Pass Operational Amplifier
<ul>
    A high pass filter will allow the frequencies which are higher than the cut-off frequency and attenuate the frequencies lower than the cut off frequency.                        <img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (506)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bcf30c-57ce-48ce-8559-e2aa42707908" />

</ul>

### 6. Current Mirror
<ul>
    The circuit is used to copy the flow of current in one active device and controlling the flow of current in another device by maintaining the output current stable instead of loading

</ul>

### 7. Operational Amplifier
<ul>
    An Operational Amplifier, or Op-amp for short, is fundamentally a voltage amplifying device designed to be used with external feedback components such as resistors and capacitors between its output and input terminals.

</ul>

### 8. Small Signal Analysis
<ul>
    Devices like BJTs or MOSFETs have non-linearly but when the input signal is small, we can approximate the device as linear around its operating point.
    This approximation is known as Small Signal Analysis.
